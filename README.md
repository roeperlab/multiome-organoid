# multiome-organoid

Repository for analysis of MET in human iPSC-derived renal organoids.

The scRNA-seq and multi-ome profiling data of organoids are available at the GEO accession associated with our paper (coming soon).

- Single cell analysis of organoids was performed by John-Poul Ng-Blichfeldt: https://github.com/jblich870. 
- Single cell analysis of human fetal kidney was performed by Benjamin J Stewart: https://github.com/bjstewart1.

Data are available for download from GEO database: GSE232787.

This repository contains files which illustrate the methodology in our paper.
