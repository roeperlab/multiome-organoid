# multiome-organoid

Repository for analysis of MET in human iPSC-derived renal organoids.

The scRNA-seq and multi-ome profiling data of organoids are available at the GEO accession associated with our paper (coming soon).

Single cell analysis of organoids was performed by John-Poul Ng-Blichfeldt https://github.com/jblich870. 
Single cell analysis of human fetal kidney was performed by Benjamin J Stewart: https://github.com/bjstewart1.

GEO: (coming soon)

# Analysis pipeline
This repository contains the following files which illustrate the methodology in our paper.

- SC_analysis_pipeline_batch1.R (single cell analysis pipeline for batch 1)
- SC_analysis_pipeline_batch2.R (single cell analysis pipeline for batch 2)
- SC_analysis_pipeline_batch3.R (single cell analysis pipeline for batch 3)
